# 🔧 Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Current Status Check

Your repository is now properly configured with:
- ✅ Fixed `render.yaml` configuration
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with correct start script
- ✅ Built `dist` folder included
- ✅ Multiple deployment guides
- ✅ All files committed and pushed to GitHub

## 🚨 Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails on Render/Vercel/Netlify

**Symptoms**: Build logs show errors, deployment fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if build works locally first
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# If it fails locally, fix the issues first
```

**Common fixes**:
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check for syntax errors in React components
- Verify all imports are correct

### Issue 2: App Deploys But Shows Blank Page

**Symptoms**: Deployment succeeds but app doesn't load

**Solutions**:
1. **Check the start command**:
   - Render: `cd frontend && npm run start`
   - Vercel: Auto-detects (no start command needed)
   - Netlify: No start command needed

2. **Check routing configuration**:
   - Ensure `_redirects` file exists in `frontend/` folder
   - Content should be: `/* /index.html 200`

### Issue 3: Port Errors

**Symptoms**: "Port already in use" or "EADDRINUSE" errors

**Solutions**:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated `package.json` to use `$PORT` environment variable
- The start script now correctly uses: `"start": "vite preview --port $PORT"`

### Issue 4: Static Assets Not Loading

**Symptoms**: CSS/JS files return 404 errors

**Solutions**:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Built `dist` folder is now included in repository
- Assets are properly built and available

## 🎯 Platform-Specific Instructions

### Render Deployment
```
Repository: Varshamadavaneri/recipe-generator
Build Command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
Start Command: cd frontend && npm run start
Instance Type: Free
```

### Vercel Deployment
```
Repository: Varshamadavaneri/recipe-generator
Framework: Vite
Root Directory: frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
```

### Netlify Deployment
```
Repository: Varshamadavaneri/recipe-generator
Base Directory: frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Publish Directory: frontend/dist
```

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Local Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```
If this works locally, deployment should work.

### Step 2: Check GitHub Repository
Visit: https://github.com/Varshamadavaneri/recipe-generator
Verify these files exist:
- ✅ `render.yaml`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT-SIMPLE.md`
- ✅ `frontend/package.json` (with correct start script)
- ✅ `frontend/dist/` folder

### Step 3: Check Build Logs
On your deployment platform, check the build logs for:
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Build completed without errors
- ✅ Start command executed

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Test

### Test on Render (Recommended)
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. New → Web Service
3. Connect: `Varshamadavaneri/recipe-generator`
4. Use settings from `DEPLOYMENT-SIMPLE.md`
5. Deploy!

### Test on Vercel (Alternative)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. New Project
3. Import: `Varshamadavaneri/recipe-generator`
4. Configure: Root = `frontend`, Build = `npm run build`
5. Deploy!

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still having problems:

1. **Check the build logs** on your deployment platform
2. **Try a different platform** (Render → Vercel → Netlify)
3. **Verify all files are on GitHub** at the repository URL
4. **Test the build locally** first

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ App loads at the provided URL
- ✅ All features work (recipe search, meal planning, etc.)
- ✅ No console errors in browser

---

**Your app is ready to deploy!** 🎉
